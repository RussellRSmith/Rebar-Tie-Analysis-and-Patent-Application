# Rebar-Tie-Analysis-and-Patent-Application
Concrete possesses high compressive strength but lacks significant tensile strength; therefore, rebar is traditionally placed in the lower tension zone of slabs to manage structural loads. This repository details the design and analysis of a compact rebar-tie system that is easy to transport, store, and apply.

### Theoretical Framework
As concrete undergoes load variations and temperature changes, it must expand and deform without structural damage. Since both iron and concrete have similar coefficients of thermal expansion, rebar is an ideal material to insert into the lower half of the slab to handle tensile loads. If placed too high in the slab, it doesn't provide the necessary support, and if placed too low, any cracks permit water to enter and damage the rods, resulting in failure over time. It is therefore necessary to establish a method in which the rebar can be efficiently locked into a grid-like pattern and elevated to the proper height in one step. Furthermore, it is necessary to satisfy the following criteria:

  * **Minimize shipping costs and storage space: This product comes in chains that interlock and stack in a box (see images), such that 8,000 units fit within a 2ftX2ftX2ft box. This minimizes shipping and storage volume.
  * **Hold a minimum of 500 lbs without buckling: By setting the locking mechanism directly above the supporting rods, there is a direct line of force from the rebar to the ground, while minimizing the use of materials.
  * **Be injection moldable: Each chain requires multiple cavities so it becomes a balance between expected sales volume and the cost of each cavity.
