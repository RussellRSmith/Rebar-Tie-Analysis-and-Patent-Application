# Rebar-Tie-Analysis-and-Patent-Application
Concrete possesses high compressive strength but lacks significant tensile strength; therefore, rebar is traditionally placed in the lower tension zone of slabs to manage structural loads. This repository details the design and analysis of a compact rebar-tie system that is easy to transport, store, and apply.
